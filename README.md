Developed a C++ automated hardware configuration engine designed to construct optimal PC builds by evaluating component compatibility (e.g., matching CPU and Motherboard sockets) against user-defined budgets. Built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the application implements a Greedy optimization algorithm to maximize system performance. The system utilizes a specific quality-to-price ratio logic (Quality / Price) for component sorting and iteratively upgrades a baseline configuration by evaluating available parts against a strict priority hierarchy (GPU > CPU > Storage). The final output provides the optimal hardware selection and calculates the total system cost while strictly adhering to the financial constraints.
